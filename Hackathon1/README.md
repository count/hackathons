# The Task 👨‍💻:

- Work in groups, or individually, to come up with interesting, opportunistic, or amusing findings using the data we've provided, or data you find on your own
- When you have something you want to share, share the link or image so others can see what you've found
- If you see a visual you like, please show it some love on Slack with a 👍😍👏⭐️ or something similar. This is how we decide who gets the prizes!
- At the end, we'll give anyone a chance to share parts of their analysis, and their findings (last chance to get votes)
- Lastly, we'll announce the winners!

# The Topics 🇬🇧: 
- The next "big" Borough: Find out where you should be investing
- A Clean Commute: A look at transportation and enviromental data to find the cleanest way to commute to work
- The London Economy: A deep dive into the London economy past and future. Try to find how your industry is trending
- Have something else you want to explore? Feel free to work on your own, or if you're up for it, start your own team!

# The Rules 👩‍🏫:

- If you use data you've found, please make sure it's allowed to be shared with others
