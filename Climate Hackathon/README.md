# The Data 📈:

- Sources:
    - Eurostat: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database)
        - Good for aggregated data over time and by EU country. Covers a wide range of topics
        - Please note, many of these have ambigious coded variables. I've included the dictionaries for most of these in the "eurostat_dict" folder, but if you need more check out this site: http://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabularies
        
    - Copernicus: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home)
        - Good for mapping global climate and general weather indicators (e.g. wind speed, pressure, temperature, etc.)
        
- Pre-cleaned data can be found in the "Datasets" folder of this repo, or at this wetransfer [link](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/4bf009823d245824b54f25a29cfc5f8620190117103547/6a8cbf01cc4a126d7443f5f0a3ddeb2a20190117103547/caf5e2).

- Example notebooks can be found in the "Example Notebook" folder, or on our [hosted notebooks](https://play.count.co/jupyter/tree/work) Password: 5257b6c121e4a458a977998d402c939f04939791c42c16f4
