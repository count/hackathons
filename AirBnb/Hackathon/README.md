# Hackathon: 20 May

## [#AirBnBHackathon](https://twitter.com/DataHackathons?lang=en-gb/)

# The Topic¬†:
**The effects of AirBnB on London** 

# The Challenge üë®‚Äçüíª:
Today we'll be exploring AirBnb data in London. You have a choice of challenges:
1. Pick a neighbourhood and assess the impact Airbnb could be having. Does this differ from effects seen in other areas of London? How so?
2. Which borough has fared the best/worst from Airbnb?
3. If you were to host an Airbnb in London, where would you do it to get the most bang for your buck? What type of listing would it be?
4. Or, pick your own!


# The Purpose:
Develop and test your data analysis skills, learn from one another. Collaborate with others to uncover new insights about today's topic.
