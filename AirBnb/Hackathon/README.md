# Hackathon: 7 June

## [#AirBnBHackathon](https://twitter.com/DataHackathons?lang=en-gb/)

# The Topic¬†:
**The effects of AirBnB on London** 

# The Challenge üë®‚Äçüíª:
Today we'll be exploring AirBnb data in London. You have a choice of challenges:
1. You are in the market for a new place to live in London. You plan on posting it to AirBnB quite often. Which borough gives you the best ROI? What kind of listing? How long would it take to make your money back?

2. You are working for the government trying to spot people violating the 90 day rental policy. Which properties are most likely violating the rules? Which borough has more high risk properties? Which hosts?



# The Purpose:
Develop and test your data analysis skills, learn from one another. Collaborate with others to uncover new insights about today's topic.
