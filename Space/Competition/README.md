# Competition Announcement

### Description 🏅

Many of you have told us you wished you had more time with the data to come up with something really interesting. Well now, you've got it!

In this competition, we'll use the same Space data you've seen at our last 2 [events](https://www.meetup.com/London-Open-Data-Hackathons/), but you'll get a week and a half to create an interesting story. 

 Our team will judge submissions based on:

- How compelling is the overall story
- How well the story was told (e.g. how clear are the visuals in conveying the point)

### The Details 🤓

The competition closes at **23:55 03/03/2019**.

Winners will be revealed on the 4th of March from [@DataHackathons](https://twitter.com/DataHackathons).

3. You may analyse the data using any tool(s) you wish

### The Submission 💾

Submit your entry [here](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4851828/Space-Data-Competition-Entry-Form)!

1. Ensure your files start with: “Count_Space_Competition_Firstname_Lastname”
2. Your submission should include:

    a) Your visualisation(s) in a format readable by us (e.g. `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, URL if hosted online etc.)
    
    b) A list of questions you sought to answer and your thought process in answering them.
